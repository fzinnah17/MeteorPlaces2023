I had issues enabling CORS because of requestiong from the Google Maps API to the localhost.
For the Same-Origin Policy which is a security measure enforced by web browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the web page. In this case, the request is being made to 'https://maps.googleapis.com/' from 'http://localhost:3000', which is a different domain.
So, I needed to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on the server. 



Here's how the flow will work from frontend to backend:

The user interacts with the client-side interface and clicks the "Search" button.

The client-side code (React component) will handle the button click event and invoke a function that sends an HTTP request to the server.

The server-side code (Express application) will receive the incoming request from the client.

In the server-side code, the route handler associated with the request will be executed. In your case, it's the route /api/place/textsearch/json.

Inside the route handler, the server-side code will use Axios to make an HTTP request to the Google Maps Places API, passing the necessary parameters like the query, radius, and type.

Axios will send the HTTP request to the Google Maps Places API and retrieve the response.

The server-side code will receive the response from the Google Maps Places API.

Finally, the server-side code will send the response back to the client, which can be accessed in the client-side code and used to update the user interface.
